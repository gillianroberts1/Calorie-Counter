# Calorie-Counter

Calorie counter app as part of freeCodeCamp Javascript Course

I learned how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update the interface to display the results.

In this project I learned basic regular expressions, template literals, and the addEventListener() method.
